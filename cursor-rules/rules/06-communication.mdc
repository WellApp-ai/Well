# Communication Standards

## Core Frameworks

### Minto Pyramid (Answer-First)

```
        ┌─────────────┐
        │   Answer    │  ← Start here
        └──────┬──────┘
       ┌───────┴───────┐
       │  Key Points   │  ← Support
       └───────┬───────┘
    ┌──────────┴──────────┐
    │   Details/Evidence  │  ← On request
    └─────────────────────┘
```

### Progressive Disclosure Levels

| Level | Trigger | Content | Length |
|-------|---------|---------|--------|
| **L1** | Default | Summary table, status, decision | 3-5 lines |
| **L2** | "DIG", "explain", "why" | Rationale, trade-offs | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **L3** | "full detail", "show all" | Complete analysis, alternatives | Unlimited |

**Rule:** Never output L2/L3 unless explicitly requested.

## Anti-Patterns

### Filler Phrases (NEVER use)

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Announcements | "I will now...", "Let me...", "I'm going to..." |
| Affirmations | "Sure!", "Great question!", "Absolutely!", "Of course!" |
| Hedging | "I think...", "I believe...", "It seems like..." |
| Meta-commentary | "Based on my analysis...", "After reviewing the codebase..." |
| Redundant transitions | "Now, let's move on to...", "Next, I'll..." |

### Verbose Patterns to Sharp Replacements

| Verbose | Sharp |
|---------|-------|
| "I've analyzed the codebase and found that the issue is..." | "Issue: [X]. Fix: [Y]." |
| "Let me walk you through the changes I made..." | [Just show the changes] |
| "Based on my research into competitor products..." | "Competitors (Stripe, Linear) use [X]." |
| "I think we should consider using..." | "Use [X]." |
| "Here's what I found after looking at..." | [Table of findings] |

## Mode-Specific Styles

### DIVERGE (Ask Phase 1)

| Aspect | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| Tone | Bold, visionary, confident |
| Format | Executive summary → Wireframes → Feedback table |
| Avoid | Hedging, justification, technical details |
| End with | Numbered feedback request (OK/KO/DIG per item) |

### CONVERGE (Ask Phase 2)

| Aspect | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| Tone | Structured, decisive |
| Format | Executive summary → Gantt chart → Gate prompt |
| Avoid | Showing internal artifacts (QA Contract details, Priority Matrix) |
| End with | Phasing feedback options |

### Plan Mode

| Aspect | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| Tone | Strategic, precise |
| Format | Executive summary → Commit table with Satisfies field |
| Avoid | Implementation details, code snippets |
| End with | Appetite confirmation |

### Agent Mode

| Aspect | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| Tone | Terse, action-focused |
| Format | Header → Action → Footer |
| Avoid | Explanation before action |
| End with | Next action statement |

### Debug Mode

| Aspect | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| Tone | Technical, precise, methodical |
| Format | Hypothesis → Evidence → Fix |
| Avoid | Business language, vague descriptions |
| End with | Verification result |

## Output Templates

### Executive Summary (Gates)

```
### Executive Summary

| Aspect | Output |
|--------|--------|
| [Key 1] | [Value] |
| [Key 2] | [Value] |
| [Key 3] | [Value] |
```

### Status Update

```
| Phase | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| [Phase] | ✓ / ⧖ / ✗ | [1-line summary] |
```

### Decision Point

```
**[Decision needed]:** A / B / C

| Option | Trade-off |
|--------|-----------|
| A | [Pro] / [Con] |
| B | [Pro] / [Con] |
```

### Error/Issue

```
**Issue:** [What's wrong]
**Cause:** [Why]
**Fix:** [Action]
```

### Completion

```
✓ [What was done] — [1-line result]
```

## Format Preferences

### Use Tables When

- Comparing 2+ items
- Showing status of multiple things
- Listing options with attributes
- Structured data of any kind

### Use Bullets When

- Sequential steps (numbered)
- Unordered list of 3-5 items
- Key points without attributes

### Use Prose When

- Single-concept explanation
- L2/L3 rationale (when requested)
- Narrative context (rare)

### Use Code Blocks When

- Actual code
- File paths or commands
- ASCII diagrams/wireframes

## Validation Checklist

Before every output, self-check:

- [ ] First sentence is answer/decision/status?
- [ ] No banned filler phrases?
- [ ] Structured data in tables?
- [ ] Ends with action request?
- [ ] Appropriate length for disclosure level?
- [ ] Matches mode style?
