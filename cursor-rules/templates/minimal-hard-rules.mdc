# Hard Rules (Minimal Template)

Customize this file for your tech stack. These rules are **always applied**.

## Mode Trigger Enforcement

When ANY mode trigger keyword is detected, you MUST:

1. **STOP** - Do NOT take any action yet
2. **READ** the full mode file
3. **EXECUTE** phases in order
4. **WAIT** at each gate for user confirmation

| Keywords | Mode File |
|----------|-----------|
| "init", "start feature" | `modes/init.mdc` |
| "ask", "explore" | `modes/ask.mdc` |
| "plan", "design" | `modes/plan.mdc` |
| "commit" | `modes/commit.mdc` |
| "push PR" | `modes/push-pr.mdc` |

## Code Quality

```bash
# Update these commands for your project
npm run typecheck  # Type checking
npm run lint       # Linting
npm run test       # Testing
```

## Reuse First

Before creating ANYTHING new, search for existing:

1. Components in your UI library
2. Hooks for common logic
3. Services for API calls
4. Types and interfaces

## Communication

- First sentence = answer or decision (BLUF)
- Use tables for structured data
- No filler phrases ("I will now...", "Sure!")

## Deployment

- NEVER push directly to main branch
- ALL changes through PR process
